# Memory-Puzzle-Game-in-Python
This is a memory puzzle game developed using Python and the Pygame library. The game features a visually appealing interface with a grid of cards, each with a hidden image. The player must flip over pairs of cards to find matches and rack up points. The game includes a scoring system and tracks the player's progress throughout the game. The code utilizes object-oriented programming concepts, Pygame's built-in event handling mechanism, and several helper functions to handle game logic and rendering. Additionally, the game's visual elements are defined using RGB color values and the game's state is stored in global variables. The code also employs the use of the random module to randomly generate the game's board and shuffle the shapes and colors on the board. The repository includes detailed instructions on how to set up and run the game, including any dependencies that need to be installed. This is a fun and interactive way to test your memory skills.
